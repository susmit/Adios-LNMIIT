 Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.

 ## Technical Discussion
 * Implemented the thanos effect the same way the Google did it
 * Although reverse engineering google way with chrome tools is difficult beacause they had uglified their code.
 * Basic idea is simple conver HTML elements to screenshot with html2canvas.
 * Now put image on canvas object
 * then we have to assign pixels to multiple canvas of the image
 * now we apply animations and transformation to achieve the thanos disintegration effect.
